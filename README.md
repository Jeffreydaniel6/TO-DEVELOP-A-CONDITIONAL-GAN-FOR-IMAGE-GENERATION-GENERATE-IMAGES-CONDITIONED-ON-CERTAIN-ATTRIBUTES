# TO-DEVELOP-A-CONDITIONAL-GAN-FOR-IMAGE-GENERATION-GENERATE-IMAGES-CONDITIONED-ON-CERTAIN-ATTRIBUTES
 This project implements a Conditional GAN (cGAN) to generate realistic images based on input labels or attributes. Built using PyTorch and trained on datasets like MNIST or CelebA, it enables controlled image synthesis for applications in image generation, augmentation, and creative AI.
