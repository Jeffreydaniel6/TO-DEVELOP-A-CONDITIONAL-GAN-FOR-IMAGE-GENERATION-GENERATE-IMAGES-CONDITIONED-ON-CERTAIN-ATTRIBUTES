🎯 Project Title: Conditional GAN for Image Generation

📌 Description

This project implements a **Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN)** that generates high-quality images based on specific input labels or attributes. Unlike traditional GANs that produce random outputs, a cGAN allows for **controlled image synthesis**—for example, generating a digit “7” when the label "7" is given, or producing a smiling face when the attribute "smile" is provided.

The project is developed using "PyTorch", and trained on labeled datasets like "MNIST" or "CelebA", showcasing how cGANs can be used in applications such as:

* Image synthesis
* Data augmentation
* Creative content generation

🧠 Objective

To design and train a **Conditional GAN** that learns to generate realistic images based on given labels, improving user control over the image generation process.

⚙️ Tech Stack & Tools

* Python
* PyTorch
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* TensorFlow & Keras (optional setup)

### 🛠️ Project Workflow

1. Setup

   * Install required libraries
   * Choose a suitable dataset (e.g., MNIST or CelebA)

2. Data Preparation

   * Resize and normalize images
   * Apply one-hot encoding to labels

3. Model Development

   * Build the **Generator** and **Discriminator** architectures
   * Use fully connected layers, LeakyReLU (D), and Tanh (G) activations

4. Training

   * Train both models using **Binary Cross-Entropy Loss**
   * Use the **Adam optimizer** (learning rate: 0.0002)
   * Monitor training performance and generate sample images periodically

5. Evaluation & Optimization

   * Visual inspection of generated images
   * Apply techniques like batch normalization or early stopping

6. Deployment

   * Save trained model
   * Build an interface to input labels and generate images

---

🧪 Final Output

A function like `generate_image(4)` takes a label (e.g., digit "4") and produces a 64x64 synthetic image corresponding to that label using the trained generator.

✅ Conclusion

This project showcases the power of **Conditional GANs** in producing realistic and controlled image outputs. It highlights the adversarial learning mechanism, where the Generator and Discriminator improve each other through competition, enabling high-quality image synthesis for various real-world applications.
